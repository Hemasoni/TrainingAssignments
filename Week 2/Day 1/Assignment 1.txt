1.Why do we use position property in CSS?
The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.
The CSS position property defines the position of an element in a document. 
This property works with the left, right, top, bottom and z-index properties to determine the final position 
of an element on a page.

There are five different position values:

a)static
b)relative
c)fixed
d)absolute
e)sticky



2. What is the difference between position property values :  absolute / relative;
An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted
away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
