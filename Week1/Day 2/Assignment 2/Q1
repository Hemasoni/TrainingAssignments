1. How to apply style to first letter of the paragraph?

We can apply style only to the first letter of a paragraph using the <span> tag. As it is an inline element, there won't be any
line break and we can just style the initial part of the text.
eg.

span{
            font-style:italic;
            color:red
            font-size:100px;
        }
	<p>
        <span>T</span>his is how we style the first letter of the paragraph.
  	</p>
