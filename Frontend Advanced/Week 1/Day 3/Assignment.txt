1. What is BOM? What is difference between DOM and BOM?
The Browser Object Model (BOM) is a browser-specific convention referring to all the objects exposed by the web browser. 
The BOM allows JavaScript to interact with the browser. The BOM consists of the objects navigator, history, screen, location 
and document. There are no standard set of rules, each browser has its own standards for implementing BOM.
DOM (Document Object Model) is a collection of functions and attributes that we use to create JavaScript programs.
DOM can be used in HTML, XM and SVG. DOM is not only used for JavaScript programming but can be used for other programming as well.


2. What is event target property in javascript?
The event.target property helps find the name of the HTML element used to trigger the event. For example, if we call a function from an HTML 
element click event, we can determine the specified element name to trigger and call a function.To get that property, we call event.target and 
store it in a variable like let variable = event.target. Now, we can get multiple event.target properties with that variable.
It returns a reference to the object on which the event occurred. With the help of the target property of the event, we can do the following tasks.
a)We can get the element that triggers the event.
b)We can get access to the element properties.
c)We can easily modify some properties of the element.
